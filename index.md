# STM32MP157 for Klipper

STM32MP157 is a SoC, with 2 Cortex-A7 and a Cortex-M4 processors. Cortex-A processors can run Linx up to 800 MHz adn Cortex-M core can run real-time applications with up to 209 MHz.

This means we can use single SoC chip to run both Linux OS and control printer's movement in real time, thus eliminating a need for controller boad and Linux computer.

**Current phase is development phase, which means all the development is done on a test board.**
